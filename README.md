# MyApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.1.2.

## Development server

Run `docker-compose up` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
Make sure you `export USER=$(id -u)` before running docker-compose or add it to `.bashrc` so you dont have to export it everytime.

## Access Angular CLI

Run `docker-compose run web sh` to get an interactive shell.
From here all angular cli commands will work like `ng generate` 

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
